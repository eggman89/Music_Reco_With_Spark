# Music Recommendation Using Spark

This project attempts to answer the following 3 questions :

1) Given the listetning habit of a user, how can we reccomend him the best songs suiable to his profile?
We use  a hybrid of collabarative filtering and content based filtering to achieve this.

2)Given a set of songs and it's attributes (i.e tempo, energy, dancablity and loudness) , can we predict the tag for new songs(e.g. CLassic Rock, Pop etcc..)?

3) Given the recent listetning habits of a lot of users in recent times (120k users), can we predict if a new song would be hit or not ?

The dataset has beenn aquired from MillionSongDataset, LastFM and echonest APIs.

More details would be added soon.
